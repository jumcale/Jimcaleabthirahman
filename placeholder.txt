This directory contains placeholder images for the portfolio.
You can replace these with your actual project screenshots and profile photo.

To add your images:
1. Upload your profile photo as 'profile.jpg'
2. Add project screenshots (mltrader.jpg, baxnaano.jpg, etc.)
3. Or use image URLs in the admin dashboard

For now, the portfolio will show default icons for projects without images.
